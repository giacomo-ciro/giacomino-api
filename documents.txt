He is currently working as a researcher at the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics. His research focuses on Machine Learning applied to Biology, specifically developing BioFormer: a novel architecture for gene expression modeling. Giacomo is also exploring and empirically measuring scaling laws of machine learning models when applied to transcriptomics data.
The BioFormer project he's working on represents a novel approach to gene expression modeling using transformer architectures.
Giacomo secured two formal research contracts for the ERC-funded MicroC project under Prof. Francesca Buffa's guidance.
Giacomo designed a novel model architecture leveraging prior biological knowledge and insights from AlphaFold 2 for gene expression modeling.
Giacomo uses SLURM for efficient job-scheduling on high-performance computing clusters.
